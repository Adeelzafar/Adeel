### [Classifying Pet Breeds](https://github.com/Adeelzafar/My-Version-of-Fastai-Course/blob/main/PET_Breed_Prediction.ipynb)
Just few years ago, Pet Breeds classification problem was considered challenging task. However, today it has become too easy! Thanks to the fastai and other such libraries. For the complete code, please visit the [Blog](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/the-learning-rate-finder-9203fdc67c92) that explains the project and the key concept of learning rate finder.

### [Topic Modeling](https://github.com/Adeelzafar/NLP-Course/blob/main/NLP_Lab_1_Topic_Modeling.ipynb)
To practically perform the task we will be using the 20Newsgroups dataset from the sklearn library. We will be using SVD and NMF for our experimentation as there are other great resources for LDA and PLSA. please visit the [Blog](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/an-overview-of-topic-modeling-with-nlp-17d3bf3e3624) that explains the project and the dataset.

### [Training a Digit Classifier using fast.ai](https://github.com/Adeelzafar/My-Version-of-Fastai-Course/blob/main/Pixel_Similarity.ipynb)
Pixels are the foundation of computer vision and the MNIST dataset is used as a hello world program for image recognition problems. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits collected by National Institute of Standards and Technology. Almost every deep learning library has this dataset as part of their toy datasets. The fastai also provides samples of MNIST dataset. Lets try our hands on the MNIST_SAMPLE provided by fastai to create a model that classifies 3 or a 7. please visit the [Blog](https://medium.com/analytics-vidhya/pixels-the-foundation-of-computer-vision-89ef72f31cfa) that explains the project and the dataset.

### [Rock-Paper-Scissors Image Classification using fastai](https://github.com/Adeelzafar/My-Version-of-Fastai-Course/blob/main/CustomDataset_Rock_Paper_Scissors.ipynb)
Rock Paper Scissors Dataset is a multi class dataset for learning computer vision. The Rock-Paper-Scissors dataset contains 2,892 images of diverse hands in Rock/Paper/Scissors poses. please visit the [Blog](https://medium.com/@adeelz/rock-paper-scissors-image-classification-using-fastai-library-e8e6b5db780c) that explains the project and the dataset.
