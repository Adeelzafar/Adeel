### Classifying Pet Breeds
We will execute this idea by coding an example of classifying Pet breeds. Just few years ago, this classification problem was considered challenging task. However, today it has become too easy! Thanks to the fastai and other such libraries. For the complete code, please visit the [GitHub link](https://github.com/Adeelzafar/My-Version-of-Fastai-Course/blob/main/PET_Breed_Prediction.ipynb)
